# SplitText
Dynamic Multi-Line Padded Text

*It works, but is very much a WIP.* 

## Usage

Include SplitText in your project. You can use the script in the traditional method like so:

```html
<script src="SplitText.js"></script>
```

You'll then need to initialise the script on document ready: 

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', SplitText.init);
```
