# SplitText
Dynamic Multi-Line Padded Text

Very much a WIP. 

## Usage

Include SplitText in your project. You can use the script in the traditional method like so:

```
<script src="checkMQ.min.js"></script>
```

You'll then need to initialise the script on document ready: 

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', SplitText.init);
```

## Changelog
